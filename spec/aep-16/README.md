## Motivation

Cloudmos is the most widely used Akash UI developed by the community and needs funding to sustain development.

## Summary

This proposal is a continuation of our previous proposal [#24](https://www.mintscan.io/akash/proposals/24) where we seeked funding from the Community Pool to the CAB wallet. Like mentioned in the proposal #24, the main purpose of this community pool funding was for Praetor App (USD76k worth of AKT) and they were successfully funded last week.That being said, the rest of the amount was for miscellaneous CAB items. We then proposed to the Akash team to fund us with the rest (213,966 AKT or ~USD95k at the time of writing this proposal) since we’ve been actively seeking funding from the CAB since early May 2022. You can see the full proposal [here]( https://forum.akash.network/t/akashlytics-developer-grant-v2/4513). For context, we applied for funding back in October 2021 for a USD100k grant, which we received and have fully consumed by now. Our roadmap evolved a little bit and we accomplished most of the initial projects proposed, but the size of the projects we’re building requires more resources to be fully completed.

As for what the funds will be used for, it will be used to directly fund our development efforts, which are well underway and moving at a great pace. We recently launched our new Akash explorer https://cloudmos.io/ which contains unique features dedicated to the Akash Network’s specific needs. We continually release new features to help deploy on the network and have a heavy roadmap in the coming months that will greatly accelerate the innovation and adoption of the Akash Network.Cloudmos (formerly Akashlytics) remains in the Akash Accelerator program as a cohort, and will continue to aggressively deliver on its established roadmap.

Furthermore, receiving the remaining funds from the CAB’s wallet is an effort towards ensuring Cloudmos’s platform and roadmap is aligned with its agreed upon milestones from initial funding. Cloudmos has also established a revenue model to ensure self sustainability going forward via monetizing some of the platform features in order to ensure that Cloudmos is not solely reliant on grants or community funding to operate.
