## Motivation

IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) is a protocol that allows different blockchain networks to communicate and exchange data with each other. In this context, IBC enables Akash to interact and share information with other blockchain networks that also support the IBC protocol.

This interoperability feature allows Akash to connect with a wider ecosystem of blockchain networks, expanding its capabilities and potential use cases. Users can transfer assets, data, and execute transactions across multiple IBC-enabled blockchains, including Akash, seamlessly and securely.

By supporting IBC, Akash becomes part of a larger interconnected network of blockchains, enhancing its functionality and providing users with more options for cross-chain interactions. This integration opens up new possibilities for decentralized applications and services that can leverage the strengths of multiple blockchain networks, including Akash's cloud computing infrastructure.

## Summary

This proposal facilitates asset exchange on the Akash Network using the ICS20 protocol. Upon approval, IBC-compatible tokens will be accessible in Akash's Bank module, while AKT will become available on IBC-connected Zones. Pylon Validator enthusiastically supports the introduction of IBC capabilities to the Akash Network.
