## Motivation

Show users what compute inventory could be brought on to the network if there was demand with the intention of attracting larger customers and training workloads who may be turned off by the limited number of available GPUs, particularly as demand increases.

## Summary

This would require gathering inventory from existing providers of compute that hasn't yet been brought on to Akash. The inventory should ideally be updated through an API but could potentially be done manually by the providers as well.
