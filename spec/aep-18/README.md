## Motivation
The Akash Terraform provider simplifies deployment on Akash and allows for interoperability with other major clouds. Luna developed the provider and requires funding to continue development.

## Summary
The Akash Terraform Provider enhances web2 and web3 compatibility by utilizing Terraform's infrastructure-as-code capabilities. It enables swift interaction with the Akash ecosystem using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or other popular programming languages, facilitating seamless integration with Web2 components and introducing Akash to the enterprise community.

Luna's contribution to the Akash Network has been significant, with over 6,000 downloads of their tool. The requested funds will be used to develop new services supporting the Akash Terraform Provider and create Terraform modules for Akash-based applications. Integration with ecosystem partners like Praetor is also planned.

This tool allows users to write and version infrastructure configurations on Akash, attracting web2 developers by enabling them to continue using Terraform. It simplifies migration to Akash, enables rapid and automated deployments, and eliminates repetitive workflows and complex management tasks. The tool facilitates the coexistence and integration of web2 and web3 infrastructure code.

Other developers are encouraged to reuse the open-source Terraform modules, promoting transparency. The Akash Community wallet currently holds approximately 1.29 million AKT, and a funding request of 65,000 AKT has been made for Luna to support these developments.
