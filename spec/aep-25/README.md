## Motivaiton

Akash is the first decentralized network with GPUs capable of general-purpose computing.

The absence of foundation models trained on decentralized networks such as Akash presents a significant challenge in establishing user confidence and adoption.

Training a foundation model on Akash establishes trust and provides valuable information to the Akash core team about various issues, if any exist.

## Summary

We're proposing (and seeking community funds for) training a foundation AI model on Akash Network, resulting in an "Akash" named open-source AI model, archived/shared on Huggingface. The full details can be found in the original Github discussion thread here (https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/300).

Benefits to the Akash community include:
- Demonstrating that AI model training can be conducted on Akash's decentralized cloud platform.
- Attracting AI and ML developers (web3 and web2) to the platform.
- Positioning GPU providers for success, following the mainnet launch (by generating demand).
- Rounding out AI use cases by adding model training (Inference and fine-tuning have already been demonstrated in the testnet).
- Strengthening Akash Networks' open-source commitment by building and contributing an open-source AI model to the broader OSS community.

This is a funding proposal asking for $48,000, which is 54,055 AKT (at the 30-day moving average price as of October 5, 2023, of 0.88798). Since the duration of the incentives in this initial experiment is long (3-6 months), using an average price mitigates some of the volatility.

Any unspent funds at the end of the experiment will be returned to the community pool OR used towards future tenant/provider incentives ONLY. In the event of a shortfall, OCL will cover the difference to avoid tapping into the community pool again. The wallet that holds the funds will be `akash1ajwyre772xyu8m94j7prtvz57w020aqnpf62lx`
