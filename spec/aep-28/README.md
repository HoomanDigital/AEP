## Motivation

Effortless Deployment from VCS (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) to the Akash Network via Akash Console.

## Summary

We propose a mechanism that allows for seamless deployment of applications from popular code hosting platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket to the Akash Network using the Akash Console. This process is triggered automatically when changes are committed to the source repository, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

By integrating these version control systems with the Akash Network, developers can streamline their workflow and ensure that their applications are always up-to-date on the Akash platform. This automation saves time and reduces the potential for errors that can occur during manual deployments, making it easier for developers to maintain and update their applications.

The Akash Console serves as the interface for managing these deployments, providing a user-friendly way to monitor and control the deployment process. This feature enhances the overall developer experience on the Akash Network by simplifying the deployment pipeline and allowing for more rapid iteration and development cycles.
